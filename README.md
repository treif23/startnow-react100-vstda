# startnow-react100-vstda

This is my "Very Simple Todo App" project that allows you to keep track of tasks you want to do. This project was completed using React.

After downloading the project, run:

### `npm install`
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.
